## SQL Injection

### Description

A SQL injection attack consists of the insertion or "injection" of a SQL query via the input data from the client to the application. A successful SQL injection exploit can read sensitive data from the database, modify database data (Insert/Update/Delete), execute administration operations on the database, recover the content of a given file present on the DBMS file system, and in some cases issue commands to the operating system. SQL injection attacks are a type of injection attack, in which SQL commands are injected into data-plane input in order to affect the execution of predefined SQL commands. The login page is vulnerable to SQL injection attacks using that an attacker can log in to the application without knowing the credentials.

### Steps

}
