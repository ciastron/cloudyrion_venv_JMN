- We had a meeting with Micheal to discuss the main services we will use to simulate a vulnerable WebApp and vulnerable API services, i.e., **VAMPI** and **Juice-Shop**.
- We had a meeting with Reza to discuss the basic concept we need to know to start working on AWS and introduce Terraform. Introduction to Terragoat.
