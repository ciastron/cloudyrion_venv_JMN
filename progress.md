We progressed on the following items:
- We started studying the state of the art of AWS environment: which services can we use to host our vulnerable API and WebApp services, how to set up an AWS EC2 instance, and how to connect to it through SSH.
- We had a meeting with Micheal to discuss the main services we will use to simulate a vulnerable WebApp and vulnerable API services, i.e., **VAMPI** and **Juice-Shop**.
- We had a meeting with Reza to discuss the basic concept we need to know to start working on AWS and introduce Terraform. Introduction to Terragoat.
- We had a short meeting with Okay to discuss a first sketch of the network infrastructure.
- Creation of a first EC2 instance with the Juice-Shop vulnerable WebApp installed (ONLY FOR A DEMO PURPOSE).
- Creation of this repo.
