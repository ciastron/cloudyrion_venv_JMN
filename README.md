# A VULNERABLE AWS ENVIRONMENT
This project aims to create a virtual environment on AWS with a vulnerable infrastructure and: 
- Vulnerable APIs (container).
- Vulnerable WebApp (container).

The final goal of this project is to start work with AWS and the technologies used to manage this infrastructure, such as Terraform, Docker, Kubernetes, and all AWS services.
Moreover, the environment will be deployed in an automated fashion. To this end, the services will be containers (e.g., Docker container). 
Finally, the environment will be subject to a penetration testing analysis (followed by a report).
